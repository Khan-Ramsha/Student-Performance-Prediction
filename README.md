# Student's score Prediction 🎓📊

Welcome to the Student's score Prediction project repository! 
This project implements a Flask-based web application for predicting student scores based on various metrics using machine learning models. 
It integrates data handling, model training, and deployment processes, designed to be efficient, scalable, and user-friendly.

# Features

#### Data Handling: Efficient ingestion, transformation, and preprocessing of student performance data.

#### Machine Learning: Utilizes multiple regression models with hyperparameter tuning for accurate predictions.

#### Web Application: Flask-based interface allowing users to input data, predict scores, and visualize results dynamically.

#### Automated CI/CD: GitHub Actions automate Docker image creation, pushing to Docker Hub, and deployment on Render with every git push. 🐳🚀

#### Logging & Exception Handling: Transparent logging and robust exception handling ensure reliability throughout the application. 📝🛠️
